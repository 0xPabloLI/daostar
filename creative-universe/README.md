# DAO Creative Universe
The DAO Creative Universe is a (physical/virtual) map of the DAO ecosystem, featuring you. It's also an experiment in decentralized branding.

## The ask
Help us illustrate and communicate the DAO ecosystem, including its projects, ideas, stories, and people.

## Getting started
1. Take a look at the assets.
2. Remix, modify, or add your own assets to the map.
3. Join the [the DAOstar Discord](https://discord.gg/crEUNHEr68) and say hi in the `#creative-universe` channel.

## Assets
All the content in the DAO Creative Universe (i.e. everything in this folder) is free for you to use. We also have a several physical assets, including a bunch of medallions, a star map, a big banner, and a couple of mobile printers. Tell us what to do with them!
